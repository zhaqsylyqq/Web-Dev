        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>If using day-old rice, transfer to a medium bowl and break rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil in a 10-inch carbon steel or nonstick skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another tablespoon (15ml) oil and remaining rice.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add 2 more tablespoons (30ml) oil to skillet, return to high heat, and heat until smoking. Add onion and carrot and cook, stirring and tossing, until just tender and lightly browned in spots, about 3 minutes. Add chicken and cook, stirring, until cooked through and starting to lightly brown, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Return rice to pan and toss until well combined with vegetables. Add thinned ketchup and cook, stirring and tossing, until ketchup sauce is reduced and each grain of rice is separate and coated in a shiny sheen of ketchup. Toss in scallion, then season with salt and pepper. Scrape rice mixture into a small heatproof bowl, packing it down. Invert a serving plate on top of the bowl of rice, then rotate both so that bowl is sitting inverted on top of plate. Set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wipe out skillet with a paper towel and return to medium-high heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat until shimmering. Add eggs and stir rapidly with a spatula, while shaking pan to agitate eggs; make sure to move spatula all around pan to break up curds and scrape them from bottom of skillet as they form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs are very softly scrambled and creamy (but still loose enough to come together into a single mass), 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Using spatula, gently spread egg in an even layer around skillet and scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. The top surface should be loose and creamy, but if it looks too liquid and raw, let cook, undisturbed, for another few seconds. (If it still flows, you can swirl skillet to send loose egg to the edges, where it will set more quickly.) Remove from heat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Lift bowl from rice; rice should hold a mound-like form. Slide open-face omelette on top of rice mound. Garnish with a squeeze of ketchup and Kewpie mayonnaise, if using. Serve right away.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Place a piece of parchment paper on a cookie sheet. Working quickly, use a small ice cream scoop to scoop ice cream balls and place them on the parchment paper. Be sure to pack the ice cream tightly in the scooper, leaving a flat edge on the ice cream so that it will sit flat on your cookie sheet. Freeze for 1 hour.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, and powdered sugar in a microwave safe bowl. Add water and stir well, until smooth.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave mochi dough for 1 minute.  Wet your spatula to prevent sticking and use your spatula to repeatedly fold the mixture. Cover, and microwave again for 1 minute.  Fold the dough again and microwave for 30 more seconds.  The mochi should look slightly shiny and if it doesn’t, microwave for 30 more seconds.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Place a piece of parchment paper on the counter and dust it with a layer of cornstarch.  Use a rubber spatula to scrape the mochi dough from the bowl and onto the parchment paper (keep in mind that it will be very hot so be careful not to touch it).  Dust the top of the dough ball with cornstarch.  Use a rolling pin to roll the mochi dough into a large rectangle, about ¼ inch thick.  If the dough sticks at all while rolling, continue to dust the top with cornstarch to prevent sticking.  Place the parchment paper with the rolled out dough on it, onto the cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> 
Remove the dough from the fridge and use a round biscuit cutter (about 3 inches) to cut circles in the dough.  Your circles need to be big enough to pinch the dough around the ice cream.  Pick up one circle of dough and gently brush off the cornstarch from the top (I like to use a dry pastry brush to do this).  Working with one scoop of ice cream at a time, (keep the rest in the freezer so they don’t melt), place one ice cream scoop in the center of the mochi and gently press the dough around the ice cream.  Pinch the edges of the mochi to seal it. Place mochi on a piece of plastic wrap bringing the corners of the plastic wrap to the center and twisting it tightly at the top.

</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Place mochi back in the freezer with the rolled plastic wrap side down. Continue with remaining dough and ice cream. Freeze mochi ice cream for at least 1 hour before eating. Once it’s frozen, store it wrapped in the plastic wrap and in a freezer safe bag or container in the freezer for up to 3 months.  Allow the dough to thaw slightly before eating.</p>
